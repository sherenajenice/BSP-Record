## EXP NO:01	RADIX-2 DECIMATION-IN-FREQUENCY (DIF) FFT
## DATE :
## AIM:

To implement the Radix-2 DIF FFT algorithm in MATLAB and analyze the frequency-domain representation of a given discrete-time sequence.
## Apparatus / Software Required:
MATLAB (any version supporting basic matrix operations)
Computer system
## Theory:
The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an efficient algorithm to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence.
The Radix-2 Decimation-in-Frequency (DIF) algorithm works by successively breaking down the computation of the DFT into smaller DFTs using a divide-and-conquer approach.
DIF splits the input sequence in the frequency domain.
The butterfly structure is used to combine the results efficiently.
Twiddle factors WNk=e−j(2πk/N)W_N^k = e^{-j(2\pi k / N)}WNk=e−j(2πk/N) are used for complex multiplications.
## Algorithm:
Input: Sequence x(n) of length N (where N is a power of 2).
Check: If N is not a power of 2, zero-pad the sequence to the next power of 2.
Step 1: Apply the DIF decomposition — divide the sequence into even and odd index parts in-place.
Step 2: Multiply the odd terms with corresponding twiddle factors.
Step 3: Perform butterfly computation.
Step 4: Repeat recursively for smaller subsequences until size N=2N
Step 5: Apply bit-reversal reordering to get the final FFT output.
Output: Frequency-domain sequence X(k

## MATLAB CODE
clc;
clear;
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]; % Input sequence
N = length(x);
stages = log2(N);

% Bit-reversal ordering
bitrev = bitrevorder(0:N-1) + 1;
X = x(bitrev);

% DIF FFT Computation
for stage = 1:stages
    half = 2^(stage-1);
    step = 2^stage;
    for k = 0:half-1
        twiddle = exp(-1j*2*pi*k/step);
        for m = k+1:step:N
            temp = X(m) + X(m+half);
            diff = (X(m) - X(m+half)) * twiddle;
            X(m) = temp;
            X(m+half) = diff;
        end
    end
